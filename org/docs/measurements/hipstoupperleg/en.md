title: Hips to upper leg
---

The **hips to upper leg** is measured at the side of your body from your hipline down to the upper part of your leg.

To measure your **hips to upper leg** measurement, put a tape measure at the side of your body where your hips sit (where you wear your belt)
and measure down to where your leg starts being a leg, and no longer is part of your bum.
