title: Making Tamiko
---

## What you need

To make Tamiko, you will need the following:

- Basic sewing supplies
- About 1 meter of a suitable fabric ([see Fabric options](#fabric-options))

## Fabric options

This pattern has a lot of unfinished edges, so you need something that does not ravel. And you want to go for something with a nice drape.

Long story short, go for a knitted fabric, or some light scuba or something. No wovens.

## Cutting

- **Main fabric** 
 - Cut **1 Tamiko top** on the fold

Tamiko is a zero-waste pattern. It's a rectangle that's cut out on the fold. Not more than that. There's only one part to this top, we will simply refer to it at the **Tamiko top**. It needs to be cut on the fold along the bottom.

> Cut out the armhole, but leave seam allowance

Below is a typical Tamiko draft:

## Construction

### Step 1: Finish the armhole seam

Finish the armhole seam with a narrow hem.

### Step 2: Finish the top

> As your top is folded, it's a good idea to pin both halves together. This way, your top can't shift around while we finish it.
