title: Collar ease
---

How much ease do you want for your collar?

If you feel that a collar is suffocating, you can give yourself a bit more ease and it will sit more loose around your neck.
You could also lower the ease for a tighter fit.

> You should probably not go below 1.5cm if you want to keep the ability to button your collar stand button.
