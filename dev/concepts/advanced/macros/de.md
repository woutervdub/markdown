title: Using macros
---

Macros are a way to facilitate pattern design by bundling a bunch of individual actions
into a little routine.

Macros are provided by [plugins](/plugins/). Here are some examples:

<Example pattern="rendertest" options={{
  colors: false,
  circles: false,
  snippets: false,
  text: false,
  widthHd: false
}}/>

Refer to [the API documentation](/api/part#macro) for details on how to use macros,
and the [extending FreeSewing](/extend) documentation for info on how to create your
own macros.
