This holds all our MarkDown content: documentation, blog posts, and showcases.

This keeps content changes out of our code workflow. It also allows editors to work on MarkDown without having to worry about breaking any code.

The MarkDown content in this repository is used both on freesewing.org and freesewing.dev.
