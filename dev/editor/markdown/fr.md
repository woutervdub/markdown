Markdown is a lightweight markup language with plain text formatting syntax. It is designed to be easily readable by humans, yet also easily converted to HTML by computers.

Markdown is often used to format documentation, online comments, or anywhere where you want rich text while using a plain text editor.

## Text and paragraphs

Text is just text. You can just start writing.

To start a new paragraph, leave a white line:

```md

To start a new paragraph, leave a white line:
```

If you want to insert a linebreak, but not a new paragraph, simply leave 2 spaces at the end of the line.

## Italic and bold

You can make text *italic* or **bold** by wrapping it in 1 or 2 asterix respectively:

```md

## Lists (listes)

To make a list, just do as you would in plain text, making sure to start with a space:

```md
 - a bullet
 - list

or

 1. A numbered
 2. list
```

Gives you:

- a bullet
- list

or

1. A numbered
2. list

## Links

Links combine square brackets for the link text with round brackets for the desitation.
