Freesewing exports a single object with the following properties:

 - `version`: A string containing the FreeSewing version number

In addition, FreeSewing's default export exposes the following method:

 - `Design()`: A *super-constructor* to create new pattern designs.

## Design()

```js
function freesewing.Design(object config, object|array plugins)
```

Use this method to create a new pattern design. It takes the 
following arguments:

 - `config` : The pattern configuration
 - `plugins` : Either a plugin object, or an array of plugin objects
 to load in your pattern

<Tip>

This method will return a constructor method that should be called to 
instantiate your pattern. 

See [creating a new pattern design](/concepts/new-design) for an example.
