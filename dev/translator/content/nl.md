title: Translating content
---

Crowdin makes translations of strings very easy.  
If you provide the translation, Crowdin will make sure your changes make it back into our repository, where they will be picked up and merged by one of the development people.

Here's what you need to know to get started:

- Crowdin link: https://crowdin.com/project/fs-markdown
- Request an invite: https://gitter.im/freesewing/freesewing

<Tip>

When translating content, please give priority to the content of freesewing.org, before tackling developer documentation for freesewing.dev. In other words, do the `org` folder first.

## Content as strings

Tranlating content used to be very different from translating strings, because you had to translate entire pages in one go, adapt links and so on.

Today, they are much the same as Crowdin breaks down all content (blog posts, documentation, and so on) into individual sentences. This may seem weird at first, but it actually has a number of benefits:

- You never have to tackle an enourmous page of documentation. Whenever you have a few minutes to spare, you can just jump in, and translate a few sentences. This makes it much simpler to collaborate with others.
- When (part) of the original (English) content is changed, Crowdin will detect that and let you know exactly what sentences need to be updated.
- It's easier to keep track of how much has been done/remains to be done
- Content is more consisten across languages

## Syntax

Content will contain MarkDown syntax. MarkDownis a straigh-forward way to format text to turn it into HTML. Youâ€™ll be familiar with it in no time.

The [official MarkDown documentation](https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/syntax) is a bit dry, but there's plenty of MarkDown guides out there.
